Welcome to the **goLance API** documentation.
The goLance API allows you to securely access company, contract and contractor data programmatically. With this API, you can integrate goLance functionality into your systems to automate operations such as retrieving timesheets and managing company information.

## Getting Started

All requests to the goLance API are made over HTTPS and require authentication using **OAuth 2.0 (Client Credentials)**.

For detailed instructions, see the [Authentication](authentication) section.
